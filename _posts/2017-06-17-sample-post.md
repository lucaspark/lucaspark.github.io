title: Free to Play Gets a Bad Rap?
description: "You'll rarely hear a developer refer to their own game as free-to-play; the term has become that toxic. Is it really all that bad, though?"

Some might say the best things in life are free. Some might also say nothing in life is truly free.

I would say they would both be right, and that both of these could apply to the world of Free-to-Play games, hereafter referred to as **<abbr title="Free to Play">F2P</abbr>**.

At their heart, F2P games really aren't that complicated. They are a genre of games in which you can download and play the entire game for free. Sounds like a good deal, right? Who doesn't like free stuff? Except that the name Free-to-play is so toxic, developers and publishers alike avoid using it at all, and bringing up the name to gamers induces an involuntary sneer. Why is this?

<!--more-->

The modern incarnation of F2P games could be traced back to early <abbr title="Massively Multiplayer Online games">MMOs</abbr> in the late 90's and early 00's, such as Maple Story, Runescape or Neopets. These games were mostly targeted at a younger age group, and while free to play, also had in game purchases that could be had with real money to enhance the gameplay experience.

<span class="phrase highlight">And that phrase, _in game purchases_, is what tends to irk people about the F2P genre.</span> 

In the early days of F2P games, these in game purchases were...shady, to say the least. While you could technically play the game for free, developers would give those who spent real money real advantages in game. Whether it was drastically reducing the grind (how many times you have to play the game over and over to get rewards), or giving extremely power weapons and gear, paying players had what was seen as an unfair advantage in game. What made this perception worse was that some games had such a ridiculous amount of grind, that the only way to realistically progress in the game after a certain point was to spend real money.

In addition, these games would try to down play the real cash aspect of the game, by not making it explicitly clear what you were spending for what. Or even worse, F2P games would spam the in-game purchases over and over again, wearing down resistance, or aggravating those who wished to play for free.

The result of these tactics would be playing to some people's addictive nature, cohersing them into spending more and more to gain an edge above the rest. These people are known in the industry as **"whales"**, and while figures vary, the whales account for less than 1% of all players, but account for the vast majority of real money income for the publishers.

These games also targeted children, and there are stories of kids spending their parents money online without the parents knowledge to get in-game items.

## BUT

There are also a large portion of popular F2P games that are genuinely fun, engaging experiences where you do not HAVE to spend money to have a good time.

These days, there are plenty of options for those who want to game on a limited budget. A lot of these do seem to be card games, as they lend themselves well for gaming on the go. Hence the one game I am featuring here is one I just started, The Elder Scrolls: Legends. It is a card game similar to Magic: The Gathering, set in the Elder Scrolls world.

Real money purchases are make explicity clear what you are buying, and while they do give you the opportunity to get more cards, they do not necessarily give you an unfair leg up on everyone else. 

I will be playing a couple F2P games over the course of months, and while I am sure there are many that will dismiss them as 'unfair junk games', what truly matters is if they are fun. And so far, there are a couple I am enjoying without spending money.

### Here are somethings to look for, when deciding whether to get started with a F2P game.

<span class="phrase highlight">Red Flags</span>

* Do they spam you with notices to purchase in-game items for real money? 
* Is the core game frustrating, slightly broken, annoying? And more importantly -- 
* Do in-game purchases take away this frustration and make the game 'less broken'? *<u>That's a huge red flag.</u>*
* Do purchases give you drastically overpowered weapons and gear? Do people who chose not to pay have no chance at winning?
* Is the grind so much that it is nearly impossible to advance without paying real money?

These are just a few things to think about. And be careful -- most **Whales** don't spend large sums all at once, but rather, end up spending alot over a long period of time. Many have no idea how much they have spent on the game until it is too late. And if you, or someone you know, has a naturally addictive personality, playing these types of games is playing with fire, and should NOT be encouraged.

<span class="phrase highlight">Even good F2P games have:</span>

* Grind - most of these games require leveling up, and that requires doing specific tasks over and over again. If you are not one who likes that type of thing, no amount of creativity in an F2P is going to sway you.
* In-game Purchases - the developers and publishers are in the game of making money. It is **HOW** they do it, not whether they do it at all, as the thing to watch. Are the purchases clear? Are they set up so that they can't accidentally be accessed and bought? Is the game fun and playable WITHOUT purchasing anything. Some people may like the game concept, some may not like it - but that doesn't mean one should just dismiss it as a terrible F2P game.

Lastly, people need to be able to recognize what is a good game and what is not. Microtransactions are not going anywhere -- for better or worse -- and thus it is on the consumer to be able to put a halt on deceptive practices and let developers know what they can play with, and what they can't, with their wallets.
