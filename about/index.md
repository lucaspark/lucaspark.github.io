## <span class="phrase highlight"> This page is designed to give myself an outlet to talk about the games I play. </span>

I plan on having at least one article about each game I play. Whether it be my general feelings on the game, history, controversy, or what have you. One of my main goals in streaming is to not just play for people, but to **engage** people, and encourage learning and discussion. There are so many things we can discover about ourselves and the world, even if it is *just* a video game.
